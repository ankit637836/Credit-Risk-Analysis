# Credit-Risk-Analysis

Our project encompasses several key goals aimed at addressing the challenges posed by credit risk and
portfolio optimization:

• Advanced Analysis Techniques: Utilizing machine learning to delve deep into credit risk assessment.
By leveraging these advanced analytical techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of credit risk evaluations, enabling lenders to make more informed decisions.

• Optimization Strategies: Exploring innovative strategies for optimizing investment portfolios to
achieve optimal returns while mitigating risks. This involves delving into methodologies such as
mean-variance optimization and the Black Litterman allocation model to develop robust portfolio
management strategies.

• Accessible Solutions: Creating user-friendly platforms or tools to democratize access to sophisticated
financial analysis techniques. By making these tools accessible and intuitive, we aim to
empower a broader audience, including individuals and smaller financial institutions, to harness the
power of advanced financial analytics for better decision-making.
